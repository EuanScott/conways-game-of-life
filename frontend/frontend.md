# Testing
For testing purposes, I made use of Angular's built in testing that can be found [here](https://angular.dev/guide/testing#set-up-testing). I, however, had to install Chrome to get this to work (slightly annoyed)

Once setup, I simply updated pre-defined tests and added my own for checking that methods can be called correctly.

> Note: In a real world example, I would also need to test my actual TS code
