# Overview

# Challenges
1. Being new to C# development, it took me a little while to get into the swing of things to figure out how the project builds.
2. Even though my work gives me a high-end gaming machine "so that I can game on it, and not only have it as a dev machine", I don't seem to have enough access to run the generated `.exe` code file.

> I haven't exactly used my work issued laptop in a long time as I only really work on the client issued laptop, so I may of missed a memo where they locked these machines down a little more than from when I started.

3. To be able to somewhat test my code, I ended up using [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to see if my code works (after I tried out the Angular implementation first)
