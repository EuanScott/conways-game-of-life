# Overview

## Challenges
1. Being new to C# development, it took me a little while to get into the swing of things to figure out how the project builds.
2. Even though my work gives me a high-end gaming machine "so that I can game on it, and not only have it as a dev machine", I don't seem to have enough access to run the generated `.exe` code file.

> I haven't exactly used my work issued laptop in a long time as I only really work on the client issued laptop, so I may of missed a memo where they locked these machines down a little more than from when I started.

3. To be able to somewhat test my code, I ended up using [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to see if my code works (after I tried out the Angular implementation first)

## Thoughts to doing this
As I wasn't able to run the code locally, I took the approach of rather porting over the Typescript code to C# using  dotnetfiddle. This made it harder to do and it took longer than I would of hoped. However, in the end I was able to at least get something working as per requirements.

## Incomplete work
1. I was not able to get around to doing any testing of the C# implementation
2. I was not able to get the game to continuously play, only create the initial state (with some added errors).
